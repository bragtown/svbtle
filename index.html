			<h1 class ="title"><a href = "">Syntagms, Narrative and the Lack of Fun</a></h1>
			<h2><a href = "">ETHAN KAPLAN</a></h2>
			<p>When we look at social software services like Facebook and Twitter, we are really talking about systems who's whole purpose is to get us to form narratives through them. We form these narratives by stringing together syntagms (fragments of text) into sequential interwoven dialogs that together form stories/narratives amongst others.</p>
			<p>The feeds and reverse chronological way these are presented is the easiest distillation of what we contribute. We are story tellers through the medium provided by other services, in both active and passive means.</p>
			<p>But when we remove all the artifice of software and features, what we are really doing is creating stories. Narratives about our day in a reverse chronological string of text and images. It mixes and infiltrates others to form meta-narratives that we hope, in the end, are contextualized somehow into something meaningful.</p>
			<p>What draws these syntagms out is active and passive modes of story telling. Design contributes to the active, and technology to the passive. Together they are interwoven into these narratives that ultimately define "Me" within a specific context. Facebook for myself in other words is nothing but the collection of narratives that I gave (actively and not) to form my identity within it.</p>
			<p>When we look at Facebook and the narrative around them vs Snapchat, Medium, and even Twitter, the difference isn't what they do (they all are about narrative formation from storytelling through syntagms), but how they do it.</p>
			<p>What is the key difference? Fun.</p>
			<p>Facebook isn't fun.</p>
			<p>If we want to get to the root of what the problem is with it right now, that is the most simple way of putting it. The WSJ might profile it about its ad business, there might be others saying its "over" (even me, in the use/on dialog), but the reality is: for something that is supposed to represent my life, it isn't as fun to use as living my life is. It's a chore, and at some point when you take stock of how you spend your time, the chores are the first thing to go.</p>
			<p><strong>The quality and the frequency of the narrative that I will contribute to any given service is proportional to how fun participating in that extraction is.</strong></p>
			<p>If you look at the ascendency of Snapchat, the attention around Medium or Instagram, and the continued growth of Twitter you see this in action. Why is Snapchat so popular? Because it is fun. The act of story telling through it is fun. It doesn't take itself too seriously or present itself as a container of utility. Instagram as well. Design contributes to this, but I think what also contributes is the conceit and trust these services grant the user. They are "make of this what you will" services rather than "do as I say and hope for the best."</p>
			<p>Where does this leave Facebook then?</p>
			<p>I think Facebook is a great engineering company, but I feel their products (outside of the microlithic ones like Messages and Instagram) have become so prosaic and utilitarian as to suck all the joy out of participation.</p>
			<p>Facebook aims to distill everything I do as a human into a machine readable form so as to contextualize my daily narrative amongst the narratives of over a billion others. And yet the mode of participation is frankly boring. There is no joy in adding content, and certainly none in consuming it. I can not express the importance of flying, or seeing a concert, because it is all distilled into a plain flat representation. Contrast this with Medium, which uses design as a means of elevating a narrative (both in how its created and consumed), or Snapchat, which uses ephemerality and the concept of "play" as a means of devaluing the import of casual communication to entice more honest representation out of people.</p>
			<p>The quality of a narrative in consumption is directly related to the joy of expressing it, and the joy of consuming it. Without joy, without fun all we have is a task and a chore. I have enough of those in my life, and I don't need another.</p>

			<h2><a href = "">NATHAN KONTNY</a></h2>
			<blockquote>Make something people want. <br><strong>Paul Graham</strong></p></blockquote>
			<p>I've made a lot of stuff no one wanted.</p>
			<p>Trying to grow my first business, Inkling, I did what good Lean Startup followers would do. I turned some of our technology into a small "project management software" prototype and used Quora and LinkedIn to set up meetings with project managers.</p>
			<p>One thing became clear fast. These project managers weren't impressed. I was often told the prototype would need to do at least everything their current tools and processes already did, before they'd consider using it with their team. They were reluctant to switch.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>There's a great story in Esquire Magazine this month about the history of Irish whiskey. 130 years ago there were almost 30 Irish whiskey distilleries. Fast forward 100 years and there was just one: Irish Distillers Ltd (IDL). IDL was a hodgepodge of brands including Jameson and Tullamore Dew. They made good products, but Irish whiskey wasn't doing well. When you asked whiskey experts what they thought of Jameson, Esquire magazine reports, "they weren't impressed."</p>
			<p>But then in 1988, a company named Pernod Ricard bought IDL and had an interesting idea…</p>
			<p>Stop selling whiskey to whiskey drinkers. Sell it to vodka drinkers, instead.</p>
			<p>And the rest is history. Jameson hadn't impressed the whiskey drinkers, but the people used to drinking light tasting spirits, like vodka and white-rum, couldn't get enough.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>A mistake I made with that project management software was spending too much time obsessing about what project managers thought. Those project managers were already well over-served by their current tools and workflows.</p>
			<p>I started making that same mistake with <strong>Draft</strong> when I first started. I contacted famous authors and journalists, and I talked with them about their processes and what they thought of Draft. The feedback was eerily similar to that project management software. I'd hear how these authors already had all these workflows they'd use with their editors and their publishers. The tools were already in place. Draft would have to do everything these other tools already did before they'd give it a good look.</p>
			<p>So I went down a different path.</p>
			<p>Instead of focusing on trying to sell more stuff to people who have plenty of that stuff, I focused on the people who don't yet have these tools or experiences.</p>
			<p>Instead of focusing on famous authors, I focused on people like me - folks just starting to eke out an audience with a new blog. Instead of selling more writing software to writers, I focused on selling version control software to people who've never even heard of popular version control software like Git before. Instead of trying to sell yet another copyediting service, I called mine "Ask a Pro", so that people who didn't understand what a copyeditor even does might still be interested in this. And sure enough, I have a bunch of people buying Ask a Pro who have never considered hiring a copyeditor to look over their writing.</p>
			<p>Today, Draft's user base is diverse. But the core user who helped propel this product into a real business wasn't a professional writer or a famous author. It was a person who didn't yet have a taste for writing tools.</p>
			<p>God - and my source code repository - knows I've made a lot of stuff that no one wanted. But it probably wasn't the stuff that was the problem. It was me not spending enough time with people who didn't have a taste for that stuff to begin with.</p>
			<p>P.S. <strong>I'd love to meet you on Twitter: here.</strong></p>
